# mcp-individual-assignment
Multi-Story Car Park individual assignment, counted for 50% as a first year second semester project for the Java CC12320 Module.

This project was written with basic Java knowledge with background in other languages so it's likely a lot of it can be improved.
It did not require a lot of features included, including the ui but these give extra marks so was great to include.
